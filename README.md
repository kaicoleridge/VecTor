<h1 align="center">VecTor Discord Bot</h1>

## 🤖 What is VecTor?
VecTor is a personal Discord Bot I have developed for my public Discord Server. I started this project as I wanted more customizability of my Discord Server such as personal moderation for my server needs, and fun commands which I find useful for myself and for my server members. 
<br>
<br> I find if I want to have certain commands I had to invite many different bots in my server, whereas I can code them myself into one bot with Vector!

## ❔ What does VecTor do?
VecTor is a multi-purpose bot with a range of commands that are suited for everyone! Moderation features are avaliable for VecTor, fun commands for server members.
<br>
<br>
A few commands for example:<br>
 - `>fact` - sends a useless random fact from therandomfactapi
-  `>news` - sends and curates the top 5 news headlines from around the world
-  `>meme` - sends a meme 

And many more!
